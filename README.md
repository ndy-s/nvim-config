# My Neovim Config
This is my personal Neovim setup built entirely in Lua. It's designed to boost productivity, provide a smooth developer experience, and remain lightweight compared to full-featured IDEs. The configuration includes built-in support for LSP, Treesitter, formatting, and debugging for common languages like Shell, Lua, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, and Java. It is easy to extend, so you can quickly add support for more languages or features as your needs grow.
